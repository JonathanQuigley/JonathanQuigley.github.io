        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Jonathan Quigley and im currently a second year at BSU. I'm a computer science major (I feel like thats
            obvious) and I'm also on the track and field team as a thrower. My main hobbies consist of lifting, throwing, playing 
            video games, and mechanical work for example cars, model cars, etc. Even though I don't play it in college, my 
            favorite sport is football. One of the reasons I chose to major in computer sciences is because I've always been interested
            in things such as web design and always liked the idea of being able to code, now the coding aspect can sometimes be a 
            challenge (thanks a lot java) I still overall enjoy most of the computer science based courses I take and projects
            or assignments that I work on.
